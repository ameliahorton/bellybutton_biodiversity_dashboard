# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

For this project, I created an interactive dashboard using data found at `http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/`. The dashboard allows you to select a test subject and view their demographic information, as well as two interactive charts based on their data, which I built using Plotly. The dataset includes information about the presence of microorganisms in each test subject’s navel. 

This project was created as part of Northwestern University’s Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp, in fulfillment of Assignment 14 - Interactive Web Visualizations.
